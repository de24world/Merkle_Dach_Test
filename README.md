## Task 1: Solution Architecture
We get the chance to implement a fitness tracking and product recommendation application. The customer wants to use the new fitness app to promote his sports wear and dietary supplement. Some REST APIs to fetch product data already exist and should be reused.
Please prepare a proposal architecture of the project. Please not just consider technical requirements, but also think about project basic conditions, like a timeframe or how many people in which disciplines you'd need.
### Customer requirements
- Responsive Design
- Progressive Web App (high performance)
- Premium design and user experience to stick out on the market
- A solution storing user data, content and translations is needed
- Reuse the customers existing REST API
- Quality is important:
- test coverage should be higher than 70%
- documentation about the software is needed
- The maintenance should be done by the customers IT team
### ToDos
- Make an Proposal for the Frontend Architecture
- Which tools / frameworks / libraries would you use for the setup and why?
- Which rendering strategy would you recommend and why?
- Make a proposal on how to care on the quality requirements
